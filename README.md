## Description
This is a simple implementation of the game Nine men's morris. The game is played on a board with 24 points and 18 pieces for each player. The goal of the game is to form a mill (three pieces in a row) and remove one of the opponent's pieces. The game is divided into three phases: placing pieces, moving pieces and flying pieces. The game is won by reducing the opponent to two pieces or by blocking the opponent's pieces so that they cannot move.

## How to play
The game is played by two players. The players take turns to place their pieces on the board. Once all pieces have been placed, the players take turns to move their pieces. If a player forms a mill, they can remove one of the opponent's pieces. Once a player has only three pieces left, they can move their pieces to any empty point on the board. The game is won by reducing the opponent to two pieces or by blocking the opponent's pieces so that they cannot move.

## How to run
To run the game, simply run the file `main.py` in a Python environment. The game will start and you can play by following the instructions on the screen.
